But enjoy it even though you are not of it?  Are you both masculine and feminine? politically aware?  And don't believe in capital punishment?  These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that  Loving someone can actually feel like freedom? are you funny?  la self-deprecating? like adventure? and have many formed opinions? These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter  These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover  I'm in no hurry I could wait forever  I'm in no rush 'cause I like being solo  There are no worries and certainly no pressure in the meantime  I'll live like there's no tomorrow  Are you uninhibited in bed? more than three times a week?  Up for being experimental? are you athletic?  Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother? are you not addicted? ...curious and communicative... \"}\n",
